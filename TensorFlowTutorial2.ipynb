One of the major difficulties right here is that the reviews in the data sets vary in length.

If you look at the actial array for our second review in the training set, you can see that there is a single \"1\" denoting the beginning of the review, a number of \"2\"s demarking unknown words (aka. words not in the dictionary), no \"3\" and no \"0\" (PAD)."
