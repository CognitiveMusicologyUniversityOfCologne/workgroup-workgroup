# jhmuwi-cgn

This repository is for exchanging and collaborating on program code relevant to seminars within the department of Systematic Musicology, Cologne University.

Course contents will be updated as we go along.

For now, it is a proof of concepts for collaborating on JupyterNotebooks via our Jupyterlab-architecture using GitHub.

As a note to collaborators:
please make sure that you work within your own branch ;-):


git checkout -b "branchname"
